# Flappy Bird Python Remake

This project was done as part of Python course. It was also originally a group project, which can be found [here.](https://github.com/CS2520-Final-Project-Group-6/Flappy-Bird-Final-Project)
I contributed to the assets, animations, and game physics. 

As a way to continue learning about Pygame, solo work was done to tweak the game logic and add more features from the original game that were not included in the original project: 
* High Scores
* Medal rewards based on score
* A more interactive and detailed menu
* Fixed a bug where pipes from a previous run would show up again when restarting


## Files: 
**bird_class.py** - Contains bird sprites, animations, and bird physics
**menu_class.py** - A framework for button sprites that are used in menus, contains fade in/out animations and positioning
**pipes_class.py** - Contains pipe sprites and movement
*main.py** - Manages the game loop and controls objects from the each class. Run this to play the game
